/* =============================================================================
   ambient.js  (isolated world, LeetCode)

   A persistent, very subtle ambient layer over the WHOLE page while the
   "First Realm" (Easy) level is active: a scattering of blurred, dim sakura
   petals drifting continuously, plus a handful of tiny points of light that
   fade in and out on their own independent, randomised cycles ("blicker"),
   like distant fireflies -- never in sync, never bright enough to compete
   with the text sitting on top of them.

   PURE CSS, NOT A CANVAS RAF LOOP. The Description-pane-only version of this
   used petals.js's canvas + requestAnimationFrame machinery, which was cheap
   at panel size. Widened to the full viewport it became an ~8-megapixel
   canvas cleared and redrawn on the MAIN THREAD 60x/sec -- competing with
   Monaco's own synchronous keystroke handling and dropping/reordering typed
   characters. Every element here is instead a plain <span> with its
   randomised path baked into CSS custom properties once at creation, driven
   by a transform/opacity-only @keyframes animation (themes/game.css) --
   compositor-only, same rule anime.css's MOTION section already documents
   for every other continuous effect in this codebase. No JS runs per frame.

   STACKING: this layer sits IN FRONT of the page (themes/game.css carries
   the z-index and the full reasoning). Don't "tidy" it back behind the
   panels: they are not translucent windows onto the page background, they
   each paint their own opaque copy of the scene photo, so anything behind
   them is invisible no matter how correctly it is placed.

   Scope: the whole viewport. Mounted once per activation (not per-pane), so
   there's no FlexLayout tab-swap tracking to do. Lifecycle keeps the same
   decaying catch-up + heartbeat shape as src/game/icons.js and
   src/monaco-ink.js -- no subtree MutationObserver, just a periodic check
   for the theme/level being on.

     own in-app router (Problem List, "Explore", the top nav, etc.) is not a
     full page load, so the same script keeps executing wherever you land
     next. Without a path check here, the ambient field kept mounting on
     /problemset/ and anywhere else in the app, since on() only ever checked
     the theme's on/off state, never the URL. Ambient decoration belongs on

     ABOVE this layer -- it's aria-hidden decoration, not real UI, so it has
     no reason to cover a dialog. Worse than a visual nuisance: if a modal's
     own glass look uses backdrop-filter, then anything still animating
     visually behind it forces the browser to re-sample that blur region
     EVERY FRAME for as long as the modal is open (the same reasoning
     CLAUDE.md's Performance section gives for why this codebase never uses
     backdrop-filter itself -- it applies just as much to someone else's).
     That matches the "lags like crazy specifically while a modal is open"
     symptom exactly, so this stops the layer outright rather than just
     visually hiding it: display:none removes it from compositing, so it
     can't be a cost to anything sampling the page behind the modal. */

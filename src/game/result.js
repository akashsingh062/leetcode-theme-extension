/* =============================================================================
   result.js  (isolated world, LeetCode)

   Gaming Theme verdict moments: the "game event" half of CLAUDE_ANKIT.md's
   verdict system (Tests Passed -> checkpoint, Accepted -> area cleared,
   Wrong Answer -> failed attempt, TLE -> time defeats you, errors -> a
   spell misfiring). Level 1 wording/palette only; the DOM shape and the
   data-kind hook are shared so Level 2 and the final level can retune them
   in themes/game.css without touching this file.

   ISOLATION -- this file owns exactly one element, #result-overlay, and one
   <style id="result-overlay-styles">. It never writes to document.body or
   document.documentElement styles, never removes or mutates a node it did
   not create, and every animated element it builds lives inside that one
   container. The existing ambient layer (src/game/ambient.js's .lctg-ambient
   with its .lctg-petal / .lctg-blicker children) is never queried, paused or
   touched -- it simply renders underneath, which is what the z-index below
   is chosen to guarantee.

   READS, NEVER WRITES, OUTSIDE THE OVERLAY. Verdict detection has to look at
   LeetCode's own result panel to know a verdict happened at all. Those reads
   are non-destructive: querySelector/textContent only, never innerHTML,
   never a style or class change on anything outside #result-overlay.

   MOTION is transform/opacity only, on every element, in every keyframe.
   Nothing here animates a layout or paint property (no letter-spacing, no
   box-shadow, no background-position), so the whole moment runs on the
   compositor and cannot compete with Monaco for the main thread -- the rule
   CLAUDE.md's Performance section sets for continuous work, kept here too
   even though a verdict is a one-shot.

  /* ---- the look -------------------------------------------------------------
     Every rule is scoped under html[data-lc-theme="game"], so switching the
     theme off leaves this stylesheet inert rather than styling a page it no
     longer owns ("Off must mean off", CLAUDE.md golden rule 5) -- the one
     thing an injected <style> would otherwise get wrong next to the
     manifest-loaded theme CSS.

     Deliberately NOT the anime theme's verdict look, which is kanji over
     converging speed-lines with a skewed colour band sweeping through. This
     is the game theme's own vocabulary, the one its title card already
     established: engraved Cinzel capitals, a thin rule with a diamond at the
     centre that light draws outward from, and a slow tonal wash. Accepted
     adds one expanding bloom ring -- a quest clearing, not an impact frame.

     Tones are the theme's own semantic roles (--lc-accent / --lc-red /
     --lc-yellow) so they track the palette, with Accepted's gold stated
     literally because no role in the set is a triumphal gold at the Easy
     level (--lc-rule is cyan there). */

/* NO opacity animation on this container, deliberately. It is viewport-sized

   would make the browser render the whole subtree to an offscreen buffer to
   blend it as a group -- and since the children change every frame, that
   buffer cannot be cached and is re-rendered every frame. That turned a
   compositor-only moment into a full-viewport re-raster per frame, which is
   what made the verdict stutter. Each child now fades itself out at the end
   of its own keyframes instead, so every layer stays independent. */

     Per-verdict detail that sits on top of the base moment above. Kept in its
     own stylesheet string and its own builders so the base is untouched.

     Two things here are deliberately NOT built the way the brief specified,
     both for the same reason the base was reworked twice:

     * The screen edge bloom (ADD-1A) and the edge pulse (ADD-5C) asked for an
       animated inset box-shadow with a 70-80px blur on the overlay itself.
       box-shadow is not a compositable property -- animating it repaints the
       whole viewport every frame, through the ~26 blurred ambient layers
       underneath, which is a heavier version of the exact bug that made this
       overlay stutter. Both are built instead as one edge-gradient layer,
       rasterised once, animating opacity only. Same look, no repaint.
     * Timings given as t=Ns are keyframe percentages of the moment's own
       duration rather than chains of JS style writes. Identical result, and
       the browser runs it off the main thread.
